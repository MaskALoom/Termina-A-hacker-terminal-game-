Not exactly sure what to put in here if I am being honest... this is the first time I've ever used github so I am a little confused. But either way I'll just kind
of explain the project a little.

TERMINAL is a game that I had thought about a little while ago about being a hacker in a terminal like environment. The game does not play directly in the your terminal
but in a separate window that acts like a terminal. The game is hade in pure C++ with Raylib as the library for actually making the game, grpahics, sound, etc.

Currently this in VERY early development and generally isn't even a game yet, but I do have some standard working commands that can inputed into the terminal.

-ls (list all files in the current working directory)
-touch (create a text file)
-rm (remove a file or directory)
-mkdir (make directory)
-cd (change directory)
-cd .. (go back in directory)
-open (open a file in the current working directory)
-clear (clears the terminal)
-exit (exits the entire game)

and I think that's about it. Later in the future I'll add more commands and the make the game... actually enjoyable to play because all you can do is just run some commands here and there.
